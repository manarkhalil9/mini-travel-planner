# Mini Travel Planner

## Project Overview
The **Mini Travel Planner** is a web application designed to help users explore destinations and organize their travel experiences in an intuitive and engaging way. The platform allows users to browse cities, discover popular tourist attractions, and view visual and descriptive information to support travel decision-making.

## Key Features
Users can explore a variety of cities and tourist destinations, view detailed information about attractions, and build personalized trip plans based on their interests. The application supports managing multiple trips, making it easy to plan, revisit, and refine travel ideas over time.

## User Experience & Design
The application focuses on clean design, smooth navigation, and an easy-to-use interface. Interactive elements and structured layouts are used to simulate real-world travel planning tools, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

## Personalization & Trip Planning
Each user can create customized trip plans by selecting places they want to visit. These plans help users visualize their journey, organize attractions in one place, and adapt their plans as their preferences change.

## Backend & Data Management
The application includes a backend system responsible for user authentication and managing application data. It supports full **CRUD functionality**, allowing users to create, view, update, and delete trips and associated travel information while maintaining a personalized and consistent experience.This project showcases practical use of RESTful APIs, database relationships, and modern frontend–backend integration.

- **User**: Handles authentication and stores user-specific information, including created trips and preferences.  
- **City**: Stores city-related details such as name, country, and representative images.  
- **Place**: Represents tourist attractions associated with a specific city, including relevant descriptive information.  
- **Trip**: Stores user-created travel plans containing selected places and trip-related details.
